🚦 Traffic Monitoring & Speed Estimation System (YOLOv8)

A real-time traffic analytics system that detects, tracks, and estimates vehicle speed from road videos using YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and computer vision–based perspective mapping.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end intelligent traffic surveillance pipeline suitable for smart cities and ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems).
